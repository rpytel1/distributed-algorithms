# Distributed-algorithms

This repository contains our implementations on 3 well-known distributed algorithms for the needs of the MSc *Distributed Algorithms* course in TU Delft. For all the implementations the Java/RMI API was used.

## 1st Assignment

The first assignment containes our implementation on **the Schiper-Eggli-Sandoz algorithm** for **causal ordering** of point-to-point messages.

## 2nd Assignment

The second assignment containes our implementation on **the Singhalâ€™s algorithm** for **token-based mutual exclusion** in a distributed system.

## 3rd Assignment

The third assignment containes our implementation on **the algorithm of Gallager, Humblet, and Spira** for **creating the Minimum-Weight Spanning Tree of asynchronous weighted networks**.
